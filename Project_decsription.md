# Brief description of the project:

My project is being designed for a custom tailoring business. I have created the database for my web application project ‘Topiwala Tailor’. Custom tailoring aims to give customers full control over their choice of material and style for clothing made custom fitted to their size.

The main purpose of the database is to gather information from customers about their measurements and materials, to make it available to the tailors so that the tailor can prepare the order. Customers can book appointments; can see different styles of clothes available; can place orders and can check the status of their orders. Customers can also choose to fill in their measurements if they prefer. 

Initially I created the Entity Relationship Model to identify which are the entities I need for my database and what are the relationships between these entities.

Based on the entity relationship model I drew an Entity Relationship Diagram which contains entities from the entity relationship model and added the list of fields to each entity.

Then I transferred the entity relationship diagram into a Relational Model and identified the Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.

Then there is the scripts for creating and populating the database and some queries included in topiwala_tailor.sql file.

Topiwala Tailor has been serving customers for over 30 years. With the development of the app, and the millions of online consumers, Topiwala Tailor is looking to expand its customer base and give its customers an easy way to interact with them for their orders.
